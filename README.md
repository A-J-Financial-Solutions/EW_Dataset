# Elliott Wave Dataset for CNN

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to building an open-source dataset for recognizing Elliott Wave patterns in financial markets using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Elliott Wave theory is a method of technical analysis that looks for recurrent long-term price patterns associated with ongoing changes in investor sentiment and psychology.

The goal of this dataset is to provide a comprehensive set of impulse wave structures from various financial instruments for use in training machine learning models.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of chart images generated from historical price data that exhibit impulse wave structures according to Elliott Wave Theory. Each image is labeled with the sequence of the wave it represents.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the community. To contribute to the dataset, you can fork this repository, apply your inputs to generate new data, and create a pull request with your additions.

### How to Contribute

1. **Fork this Repository:** Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of this page.
2. **Clone the Forked Repository:** Clone it to your local machine.
3. **Generate Data:** Use the following script to download historical price data for your chosen stock symbol within a date range that includes a full impulse wave:

   ```python
   import yfinance as yf

   stock_symbol = 'YOUR_STOCK_SYMBOL'
   start_date = 'YYYY-MM-DD'
   end_date = 'YYYY-MM-DD'

   stock_data = yf.download(stock_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)
   print(stock_data.head())
   stock_data.to_csv('data.csv')
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_STOCK_SYMBOL`, `YYYY-MM-DD` for `start_date`, and `YYYY-MM-DD` for `end_date` with the appropriate values for the financial instrument and time period you are analyzing.

4. **Identify Impulse Waves:** Manually identify segments in the data that show a clear impulse wave structure.
5. **Generate Chart Images:** Create chart images from the identified segments and label them accordingly.
6. **Commit Your Changes:** Add your new chart images and any associated labels to the `data/` directory.
7. **Push to Your Fork:** Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
8. **Create a Pull Request:** Navigate back to the original repository and click on 'New pull request'. Select your fork and submit the request.

Please ensure that any data you contribute is freely available and does not infringe on any copyrights.
